Path of Berserker: For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end--that end being violence.

rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well being.

Path of the Totem Warrior: Is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide,
protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding
magical fuel to your barbarian rage. Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a
particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal
spirit, though exceptions exist.
